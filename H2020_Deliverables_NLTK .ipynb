       "      <td>Executive Summary:\\nGlobalization has a pervasive influence over regional development in rural Europe, presenting both opportunities and challenges. DERREG has examined how globalization processes are impacting on rural economies and societies in practice, and why impacts and responses vary between different regions. In particular, DERREG has aimed to develop understanding of how regional development policies and initiatives can effectively respond to globalization and wider rural restructuring, shaping outcomes in specific regions. DERREG has been undertaken by a consortium of nine universities and research institutes from across Europe, led by Aberystwyth University. Research has been focused on ten case study regions located in eight countries, and organized around four themes: the global engagement and local embeddedness of rural businesses; international migration and rural regions; environmental capital and sustainable rural development; and capacity building, governance and knowledge systems. Research across these themes involved a range of data collection and analysis methods, including surveys, interviews, workshops, documentary analysis and media analysis. \\n\\nFrom the analysis undertaken in the DERREG research, an interpretative model has been proposed to understand how globalization produces particular effects and responses in different rural regions. The model shows that globalization processes such as market liberalization, network extension and intensification, the intensification of international mobility, acceleration of information flows and the growth of global consciousness, interact with regional contexts and capacities to produce differentiated potential effects, influenced by geographical location, regional resources, political-economic context and human capital. These potential effects are converted into actual impacts through the agency of catalysts, which can include individual entrepreneurs, corporate executives or institutional policies. Resulting impacts identified in the case study regions are numerous and diverse, ranging from foreign direct investment in branch plants to the purchase of property by foreign amenity migrants and cross-border commuters. From a rural development perspective the important question is how regions respond to these impacts and the challenges and opportunities that they bring. The detailed thematic research by DERREG has identified four key elements that are important to effective regional development strategies, and the appropriate policy interventions and mechanisms required to support them. \\n\\n1) Resilient responses to globalization require support for endogenous business. The development of international networks by endogenous rural businesses offers greater long-term resilience than foreign direct investment. Many rural businesses are engaged in international networking, but the extent of internationalization varies between regions. Network brokers can help to build the capacity of rural enterprises and connect them to international networks.\\n \\n2) International migrants can make a significant contribution to rural regional development. The DERREG research reveals a high degree of mobility of international migrants to, from and through rural regions, but their potential to contribute to regional development has been largely neglected. Initiatives to promote entrepreneurship among migrants can help to harness this potential.\\n \\n3) Global environmental awareness has created opportunities for the sustainable development of rural environmental capital. Sustainable development projects have been built into regional development strategies, but their implementation can be contested. Eco-economy initiatives need to be appropriate to regional contexts and developed through inclusive methods to build consensus.\\n \\n4) Effective regional development is supported by joint regional learning and innovation. The joint working of public administration, knowledge institutes and regional groups and individuals can increase the capacity for grassroots development initiatives through exercises in reflection, learning and priority-setting. Appropriate organizational arrangements and resources are required to ensure that such interventions are effective.\\n \\nProject Context and Objectives:\\nBackground\\nGlobalization has a pervasive influence over regional development in rural Europe, presenting both opportunities and challenges. The liberalization of markets and integration of the global economy, together with the expansion of transport and communications networks, the opening of borders and increased patterns of transnational migration, as well as growing consciousness of global perspectives on the environment and other issues, have prompted, intensified and exaggerated  processes of social and economic restructuring in rural areas.\\n\\nFor some commentators, globalization represents a threat to rural regions in Europe - undermining traditional industries, diluting regional cultures and eroding local autonomy. For others, globalization has diminished the historic locational disadvantages of rural localities, creating new opportunities for economic development, tourism and the repopulation of declining communities.\\n\\nThe DERREG project, funded by the European Union Seventh Framework Programme, has reached beyond these stereotypes to examine how globalization processes are impacting on rural economies and societies in practice, and why impacts and responses vary between different regions. In particular, DERREG has aimed to develop understanding of how regional development policies and initiatives can effectively respond to globalization and wider rural restructuring, shaping outcomes in specific regions.\\n\\nPolicy Context\\nThe policy challenge presented by globalization has been recognized by the European Commission, which has stated that \"globalization is seen to touch every walk of life - opening doors, creating opportunities, raising apprehensions\", such that \"our response to globalization has moved to the heart of the EU policy agendaâ (European Commission, 2007). The delicate balance of threats and opportunities presented by globalization is particularly significant for rural regions - which constitute 91% of the EU land area, are home to around 50% of its population, generate 45% of Gross Added Value and provide 53% of employment. Traditional industries such as agriculture, forestry and textile manufacturing are vulnerable to global competition and deregulation, rural communities are exposed to the effects of transnational migration and increasingly internationalized property markets, and traditional practices of nature management are being scrutinized in the context of global environmental concerns. At the same time, globalization has reordered notions of `1core' and \"periphery' that have historically marginalized rural regions, opening up new markets for rural enterprises and attracting new investors into rural localities.\\n\\nThe adoption of appropriate responses to both the challenges and the opportunities of globalization is critical to the future development of rural regions in Europe, and will be important to the formulation and implementation of EU policies for the 2014-2020 programming period in at least three areas. Firstly, the appropriate identification of opportunities and challenges for rural areas within the global economy will be crucial to the development of Pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy, encouraging the diversification of rural economies. Since the Cork Declaration in 1996, EU rural development policy has emphasized endogenous \"bottom-up' approaches, led by regional actors and utilizing regional resources. As such, the fundamental questions for developing rural economies in the context of globalization are how to most effectively combine regional resources and global networks for economic gain, and how to best equip regional actors to engage with globalization processes.\\n\\nSecondly, the spatially-uneven impact of globalization processes across rural areas presents challenges for the EU's territorial cohesion policies. Rural areas include some of Europe's wealthiest regions, but also some of its poorest regions. The majority of the territory designated as Convergence Regions in the 2007-2013 programming period was comprised by rural regions, including nearly all rural regions in the 2004 and 2007 Accession States. Yet, conventional notions of the economic geography of \"core' and \"peripheral' regions  are being tested by globalization processes that have contributed to significant economic growth in peripheral regions such as the west of Ireland and northern Sweden, but have further eroded the economic position of other rural regions. An understanding of the spatial dynamics of globalization and of continuing relevance of geographical factors in shaping globalization experiences is hence important for developing effective territorial cohesion strategies.\\n\\nThirdly, the sustainable management of the abundant natural resources contained within Europe's rural regions will be pivotal to the delivery of EU environmental policies and its action to address global concerns such as climate change and biodiversity. The harnessing of natural resources to generate renewable energy and provide environmental services has the potential to produce both environmental and economic benefits. However, there is a risk that policies and initiatives championed from the top-down might be contested if they are perceived to conflict with established land management practices, economic interests or cultural traditions. Engaging rural people in inclusive approaches to sustainable development is hence essential for effective environmental action, including the new expectation on the Common Agricultural Policy to support ambitious climate, energy and biodiversity targets.\\n\\nScientific Context\\nIn spite of the opportunities and challenges for rural areas resulting from globalization described above, social science research on globalization in a rural context has until recently been over-shadowed by a predominant emphasis on urban regions and systems. Such research that has been conducted from a rural perspective has tended to focus on specific processes or sectors within the rural economy. Thus, for example, an extensive literature has emerged over the past decade on the global agri-food system, including work on \"global value chains' that has detailed transnational networks of agricultural production and supply (e.g. Stringer and Le Heron, 2008). Whilst some studies have examined the impact of global value chains on rural localities in the global south, there has been little comparable research on the consequences of agri-food globalization for rural areas in Europe.\\n\\nSimilarly, research on international migration has only recently started to expand its focus beyond cities to rural areas, prompted in part by the phenomenon of labour migration from Central and Eastern Europe to Britain and Ireland after EU enlargement in 2004. Research has subsequently documented the dynamics and experiences both of migrant workers and (to a lesser extent) of amenity migrants in rural regions of Europe, however, an emphasis on individual empirical studies has meant that this work remains relatively fragmented and largely disconnected from questions of rural development (see for example Jentsch and Simard, 2009). \\n\\nAccordingly, as Michael Woods has observed, this analysis has been missing ]the input of a substantial body of place-based studies - research that might not only adopt an integrated perspective in examining the impact of different forms and aspects of globalization in a rural locality, but that might also explore precisely how rural places are remade under globalization, and start to account for the differential geographies of globalization across rural space\" (Woods, 2007: 490)\\n\\nFurthermore, the few notable exceptions to this critique - largely studies in North America or Australia - have tended to present a fairly bleak and even fatalistic picture of rural localities struggling to cope with global competition and globalization-linked industrial restructuring, with only a few privileged resort locations reaping any benefits from globalization - a contrast articulated by Epp and Whitson (2001) as being between \"global dumping grounds' and \"global playgrounds'.\\n\\nThe DERREG research has consequently aimed to respond to Woods's challenge to develop an integrated and place-based analysis of globalization in a rural context, but also to counter the fatalism of some previous studies by examining opportunities for regional actors to make a difference and identifying examples of good practice. In doing so, DERREG has drawn particularly on two bodies of conceptual literature. \\n\\nFirstly, it has adopted the \"relational approach' to globalization associated with human geographers such as Doreen Massey and Ash Amin. This approach presents globalization not as a singular, domineering force, but rather as a disparate and diverse collection of processes and tendencies that involve the stretching, multiplication, intensification and re-alignment of social, economic and political relations over space. It holds that places are never truly isolated, but that the distinctive character of a place comes from the unique intersection of social and economic flows and networks that connect it to other places. Globalization therefore involves not the replacement of the local with the global, but more subtle changes to place that result from the stretching or subsitution of these ties. Thus, as Woods observes, ]places in the emergent global countryside retain their local distinctiveness, but they are also different to how they were beforeâ (Woods, 2007: 500).  As such, from a relational perspective, localities should be viewed never as the inevitable victims of globalization, nor as strongholds of resistance to globalization. Rather, the approach argues that the global is reproduced through the local, through processes of negotiation, manipulation and contestation that involve both local and non-local actors. In this way, the relational approach has important implications for our understanding of rural development in the context of globalization. It provides a framework for explaining why similar processes produce different outcomes in different regions, including by indicating that rural entrepreneurs, policy-makers, development agents and social movements might all be engaged in shaping these outcomes.\\n\\nSecondly, DERREG has drawn on the extensive academic literature on rural development, and especially work on endogenous rural development. This research has evolved concurrently with the implementation of bottom-up strategies for rural development in Europe, and has not only documented the practice and outcomes of this approach,  but has also analysed the dynamics and principles that underlie the approach and inform the effectiveness of different initiatives. These were summarized by the EU Framework Programme 6 project ETUDE in a diagrammatic \"web of rural development' that described the interactions between six domains: endogeniety, novelty-production, sustainability, social capital, institutional frameworks and market governance (van der Ploeg and Marsden, 2008). The interactions between these domains, it is suggested, shape the trajectories of rural development in different regions - novelty-production may be combined with market governance to create new branded products, for example, whilst social capital is identified as a critical lubricant for inter-relations.  \\n\\nThe rural web is useful in envisaging and analysing relations between actors within regions, however, it does not directly consider how regional actors engage with globalization processes, beyond reference to market governance. In seeking to emphasize the regional-global interface, DERREG has therefore additionally drawn on wider literature in relational economic geography on \"network economies'. This literature has emphasized the significance of \"intangible assets' and \"organized proximity' in the global economy, supplanting the previous tendency for spatial agglomeration, and has also pointed to the importance of business networks in diffusing information and driving entrepreneurship (Boschma, 2005; Johansson and Quigley, 2004). However, empirical research testing these theories has been limited, especially in a rural context.\\n\\nFurthermore, the design of DERREG stressed the perceived importance of knowledge not only to inter-regional networking, but also to intra-regional capacity building. This built on the findings of EU Framework Programme 6 project CORASON, which demonstrated both that rural regions can benefit from the global circulation of knowledge, and that local and lay knowledge are important to innovation (Tovey, 2008); but sought to develop the analysis by adapting the concept of \"learning regions' initially conceived to analyse the interaction of industry, government and science in technology-driven urban development (Rutten and Boekema 2007). \\n\\nProject Objectives\\nIn order to respond to issues raised by the policy and scientific contexts, and with the aim of contributing both to the advancement of scientific understanding and to policy development, DERREG adopted the overall objective of producing an interpretative model that will enable regional development actors to better anticipate and respond to the key challenges for rural regions arising from globalization.\\n\\nSupplementary objectives were to:  (1) Enrich the scientific evidence base for understanding globalization-led restructuring in rural regions; (2) Promote good practice in regional development responses by assembling a database of good practice examples; (3) Provide new insights into the challenges associated with particular processes of change, including the global engagement of rural enterprises, international migration, and the globalization of environmental discourse; (4) Develop understanding of the different challenges facing different types of rural region, thus assisting the fine-tuning of regional development strategies; (5) Establish a web-based resource centre to facilitate and coordinate the dissemination and accessibility of information to researchers, regional development actors and other users interested in the challenges of globalization for rural regions.\\n\\n\\nProject Results:\\nThe DERREG project has been undertaken by a consortium of nine universities and research institutes from across Europe, led by Aberystwyth University. To provide a place-based approach, research has been focused on ten case study regions located in eight countries, which were selected to represent a range of geographical and political-economic settings (see figure 1).\\n\\nThe research has also been organized around four themes reflecting key aspects of globalization processes and rural development responses (figure 2). The first theme has examined the global engagement and local embeddedness of rural businesses, and in particular, the transactional and support networks of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Led by Nordregio, research on this theme involved an e-mail survey of over 200 firms in five case study regions to collect data on the scale and reach of business networks, supplemented by structured interviews with company managers - designed to explore the characteristics and evaluations of interactions in more detail - and \"network brokers' in the public, private and voluntary sectors.\\n\\nThe second theme has investigated international mobility and migration to rural regions, focusing particularly on migrant workers, foreign home-owners and return transnational migrants. Led by the UniversitÃ¤t des Saarlandes, the research for this theme involved analysis of statistical and documentary evidence and qualitative interviews with migrants, municipal leaders and representatives of initiatives working with migrant communities. A total of 113 interviews were conducted with migrants across six case study regions, including 50 with migrant workers, 39 with foreign home-owners and 24 with return migrants.\\n\\nThe third theme has concerned environmental capital and sustainable rural development, exploring the incorporation of local and global environmental issues into regional development strategies and opportunities for the exploitation of rural environmental capital through sustainable development. The research for this theme, led by the Leibniz-Institut fÃ¼r LÃ¤nderkunde, involved the analysis of statistics, policy documents and media reports concerning environmental issues and sustainable development, interviews with regional stakeholders, and detailed case studies in each of five study regions.\\n\\nFinally, the fourth theme has examined capacity building, governance and knowledge systems, particularly by developing and applying the concept of \"rural learning regions'. Research, led by Wageningen University, was conducted in six case study regions and involved the mapping and analysis of policy strategies to support joint learning and innovation - drawing on web searches, literature reviews and expert interviews; the in-depth analysis of a sample of grassroots initiatives in each region, including further interviews; and the identification and analysis of \"well-working' examples.\\n\\nThe evidence from each of the four themes has been collated and combined with background statistical and documentary analysis to produce an overarching interpretative model, which is presented in this report. Additionally, examples of \"good practice' in regional development responses and initiatives were collected across the four themes and ten case study regions and compiled in a searchable database available.\\n\\nThe sections below present the main results from each of the four research themes, before describing how these results have informed the development of an interpretative model of globalization impacts and responses in rural regions.\\n\\nGlobal Engagement and Local Embeddedness of Rural Businesses\\nRural business networks are potentially a key component of a new approach to territorial rural development. This moves beyond outdated concepts of the rural economy as dependent upon urban spillovers and backwash effects, or compensation for locational disadvantage. Instead it acknowledges the fact that although some of the more extreme \"death of distance' predictions of the impact of improved transport, travel and communication technology have not materialised, and face-to-face communication still plays a key role in business life, a significant incremental shift is taking place. An increasing proportion of the interaction between rural firms is no longer constrained by physical distance. Key transactions, and also non-market linkages often involve partners beyond the region, or even outside the national boundary. In academic terminology, it could be said that firms are increasingly operating within relational, rather than Euclidean space, or that there has been a partial decoupling of organised and spatial proximity. This is important in terms of economic development, because the extra-regional linkages are believed to act as channels for technical information and market intelligence which drive innovation and sustain competitiveness.\\n\\nThe existing literature in relational economic geography has described the characteristics of transaction and non-market linkages, and outlined a number of different concepts of business networks, including industrial districts, clusters, milieu, innovateurs, learning regions, etc.. A key point that emerges across this literature is that business networking can act as a surrogate for agglomeration, allowing dispersed rural firms to compete with those operating in an urban or suburban environment. The preconditions for success of rural business networks relate not only to physical infrastructure, or availability of good access to information technology (such as high speed broadband), but also to a range of \"intangible assets'. These include human capital (education, age structure of the workforce etc), aspects of social capital (an outward looking, non risk-averse entrepreneurial culture, trust, cooperative ethos), facilitative governance arrangements and so on. It is also commonly argued that the most effective and dynamic business networks are those which combine dense and highly interactive patterns of local interaction with a smaller \"external' component. This idea is often referred to by the memorable phrases \"the strength of weak flows' or \"local buzz and global pipes' (Granovetter, 1985; Bathelt et al. 2004).\\n\\nBy combining lessons derived from this literature, a hypothesis was articulated for the DERREG research on the global engagement and local embeddedness of rural businesses, as follows:\\n\\nSuccessful and dynamic rural firms derive ]networking economiesâ from frequent and effective interaction, not only with the local business environment, but also with a much more extensive set of linkages, stretching out across Europe. This implies that global integration and more local \"territorial anchoring\", are not mutually exclusive. Indeed they are complimentary aspects of a ]survival strategyâ for SMEs in rural areas.\\n\\nThis hypothesis provided the framework for empirical research in five case study regions (Ãvre Norrland, Sweden; Alytus county, Lithuania; GoriÅ¡ka, Slovenia; JihomoravskÃ½ kraj, Czech Republic; and Westerkwartier, the Netherlands). The research comprised three surveys, two targeting local SMEs and one focused on \"network brokers' who seek to develop and enhance regional business networking. The first SME survey was an electronic (e-mail) survey, with mostly \"closed' questions amenable to qualitative scoring and simple descriptive statistical analysis. A quota sampling approach was employed, with a target of 50 responses in each case study region and over 200 responses eventually being received. The second SME survey took the form of structured interviews with a subset of respondents to the e-mail survey. The main findings from the research are outlined below.\\n\\n\"Open' rural economies\\nA degree of internationalization of business transactions was observed in all five case study regions, although with significant variation. The highest levels of international engagement were recorded in Slovenia and Sweden, and the lowest in Lithuania and the Netherlands, with survey respondents in the Czech Republic exhibiting a bipolar distribution between internationally active firms and enterprises trading on a largely regional scale (Table 1). These different patterns reflect a number of factors including sectoral structure, the size of the regional market, human capital (especially language skills), local planning policy, and proximity to national borders. Nevertheless, in spite of the observed differences, the underlying trend is clearly one of SME networks in rural regions opening up to interact beyond regional and national borders. Many respondents regarded internationalization as an important step in their business development, with improved transport and communications infrastructure helping to facilitate this expansion.\\n\\nEmbedded collaboration\\nThe \"collaborative space' of rural businesses is defined by the web of non-market relations developed by firms. Interactions with other companies are very important in product and process development, as well as for market consolidation and expansion. These interactions are especially important for SMEs that are too small to afford to fully internalize activities such as research and development or marketing. In contrast to transactional linkages, the survey data shows that non-market interactions continue to be largely concentrated within the home region or country, most commonly with other SMEs (Figure 3). Transnational non-market linkages are more common in the Slovenian and Swedish case studies, but even here significantly less than the density of international transactional networks. As such, the results question the assertion in the existing literature that transactional and non- market linkages are closely aligned (TÃ¶dling and Kaufmann, 1999), and point instead to the importance of \"institutional proximity' in building trust, and the role of face-to-face communication.\\n\\nTranslocal integration\\nThe international linkages recorded by the survey were predominantly with SMEs in other regions within Europe. This finding contrasts with the presumption in the existing literature that small firms are primarily enrolled in international networks through \"vertical integration' into global value chains controlled by large transnational corporations, usually as a supplier. Our evidence points instead to rural businesses developing direct networking with SMEs that occupy similar positions in the production chain in other countries, thus advancing a model of \"translocal integration' rather than distinctively \"global integration'. This may reflect the nature of products traded by rural enterprises, and the success of rural firms in carving out business spaces outside the sphere of large transnational corporations.\\n\\nMoreover, quantitative measures of the density or intensity of business interactions at different scales do not in themselves tell the whole story about global integration. Interviews conducted for the research suggest that international linkages are often more highly valued by firms than regional or national linkages. In particular, international networks are regarded as important for information exchange, especially with respect to market intelligence. The diffusion of technical innovations through international networks, emphasized in the existing literature (Bathelt et al., 2004), was less significant for the rural businesses studied.\\n\\nRegional support networks\\nThe rural firms responding to the survey predominantly continue to rely on regional or national institutions such as government agencies, trade organizations, research institutes and business consultants for support services. In some cases, the support mechanisms accessed have European Union funding, but are delivered regionally and there is little recorded direct interaction with organizations outside the home country for support services. One of the most notable forms of support provided to rural SMEs is \"network brokerage', which can perform one of two functions. Firstly, network brokers can act as \"match-makers' between individual SMEs to extend their networks, usually by adding international linkages. Secondly, network brokers can organize \"forum facilitation' activities bringing together firms with common interests to strengthen interactions and foster collective learning. Whilst the first function commonly supports international engagement, the second might consolidate regional embeddedness. A critical factor in the effectiveness of the first function is the quality and reach of the \"meta-networks' of network brokers that span different scales and can provide access to potential international partners.\\n\\nGeographical variations\\nAs noted above, comparative analysis of the five case study regions reveals a number of variations in the results that point to the continuing significance of geographical factors. Firstly, cross-border networking with adjacent regions in neighbouring countries contributed to the degree of internationalization in Slovenia, and to a lesser extent Sweden. In contrast, the border locations of the Lithuanian and Czech case study regions appeared to present fewer opportunities for cross-border interaction. Secondly, proximity to domestic markets is a negative factor in stimulating internationalization - firms in regions with relative ease of access to sizeable domestic markets, as in the Dutch case study, have less of an incentive to develop international linkages than firms in more remote regions with smaller domestic markets, as in the Swedish case study. Thirdly, variations in national and regional policies can have an effect. Spatial planning policies in the Netherlands, for example, militated against the development of internationally-engaged businesses in the rural Westerkwartier, whilst policies in the Czech Republic are more favourable to industrial investment, possibly contributing to the higher degree of enrolment in vertically-integrated networks observed for firms in the region. Similarly, the emphasis of network brokering activities varied, with network brokers in Sweden and the Netherlands focusing on connecting firms to intra-regional and international networks, and network brokers in Lithuania, Slovenia and the Czech Republic em ...</td>\n",



       "19  Executive Summary:\\nGlobalization has a pervasive influence over regional development in rural Europe, presenting both opportunities and challenges. DERREG has examined how globalization processes are impacting on rural economies and societies in practice, and why impacts and responses vary between different regions. In particular, DERREG has aimed to develop understanding of how regional development policies and initiatives can effectively respond to globalization and wider rural restructuring, shaping outcomes in specific regions. DERREG has been undertaken by a consortium of nine universities and research institutes from across Europe, led by Aberystwyth University. Research has been focused on ten case study regions located in eight countries, and organized around four themes: the global engagement and local embeddedness of rural businesses; international migration and rural regions; environmental capital and sustainable rural development; and capacity building, governance and knowledge systems. Research across these themes involved a range of data collection and analysis methods, including surveys, interviews, workshops, documentary analysis and media analysis. \\n\\nFrom the analysis undertaken in the DERREG research, an interpretative model has been proposed to understand how globalization produces particular effects and responses in different rural regions. The model shows that globalization processes such as market liberalization, network extension and intensification, the intensification of international mobility, acceleration of information flows and the growth of global consciousness, interact with regional contexts and capacities to produce differentiated potential effects, influenced by geographical location, regional resources, political-economic context and human capital. These potential effects are converted into actual impacts through the agency of catalysts, which can include individual entrepreneurs, corporate executives or institutional policies. Resulting impacts identified in the case study regions are numerous and diverse, ranging from foreign direct investment in branch plants to the purchase of property by foreign amenity migrants and cross-border commuters. From a rural development perspective the important question is how regions respond to these impacts and the challenges and opportunities that they bring. The detailed thematic research by DERREG has identified four key elements that are important to effective regional development strategies, and the appropriate policy interventions and mechanisms required to support them. \\n\\n1) Resilient responses to globalization require support for endogenous business. The development of international networks by endogenous rural businesses offers greater long-term resilience than foreign direct investment. Many rural businesses are engaged in international networking, but the extent of internationalization varies between regions. Network brokers can help to build the capacity of rural enterprises and connect them to international networks.\\n \\n2) International migrants can make a significant contribution to rural regional development. The DERREG research reveals a high degree of mobility of international migrants to, from and through rural regions, but their potential to contribute to regional development has been largely neglected. Initiatives to promote entrepreneurship among migrants can help to harness this potential.\\n \\n3) Global environmental awareness has created opportunities for the sustainable development of rural environmental capital. Sustainable development projects have been built into regional development strategies, but their implementation can be contested. Eco-economy initiatives need to be appropriate to regional contexts and developed through inclusive methods to build consensus.\\n \\n4) Effective regional development is supported by joint regional learning and innovation. The joint working of public administration, knowledge institutes and regional groups and individuals can increase the capacity for grassroots development initiatives through exercises in reflection, learning and priority-setting. Appropriate organizational arrangements and resources are required to ensure that such interventions are effective.\\n \\nProject Context and Objectives:\\nBackground\\nGlobalization has a pervasive influence over regional development in rural Europe, presenting both opportunities and challenges. The liberalization of markets and integration of the global economy, together with the expansion of transport and communications networks, the opening of borders and increased patterns of transnational migration, as well as growing consciousness of global perspectives on the environment and other issues, have prompted, intensified and exaggerated  processes of social and economic restructuring in rural areas.\\n\\nFor some commentators, globalization represents a threat to rural regions in Europe - undermining traditional industries, diluting regional cultures and eroding local autonomy. For others, globalization has diminished the historic locational disadvantages of rural localities, creating new opportunities for economic development, tourism and the repopulation of declining communities.\\n\\nThe DERREG project, funded by the European Union Seventh Framework Programme, has reached beyond these stereotypes to examine how globalization processes are impacting on rural economies and societies in practice, and why impacts and responses vary between different regions. In particular, DERREG has aimed to develop understanding of how regional development policies and initiatives can effectively respond to globalization and wider rural restructuring, shaping outcomes in specific regions.\\n\\nPolicy Context\\nThe policy challenge presented by globalization has been recognized by the European Commission, which has stated that \"globalization is seen to touch every walk of life - opening doors, creating opportunities, raising apprehensions\", such that \"our response to globalization has moved to the heart of the EU policy agendaâ (European Commission, 2007). The delicate balance of threats and opportunities presented by globalization is particularly significant for rural regions - which constitute 91% of the EU land area, are home to around 50% of its population, generate 45% of Gross Added Value and provide 53% of employment. Traditional industries such as agriculture, forestry and textile manufacturing are vulnerable to global competition and deregulation, rural communities are exposed to the effects of transnational migration and increasingly internationalized property markets, and traditional practices of nature management are being scrutinized in the context of global environmental concerns. At the same time, globalization has reordered notions of `1core' and \"periphery' that have historically marginalized rural regions, opening up new markets for rural enterprises and attracting new investors into rural localities.\\n\\nThe adoption of appropriate responses to both the challenges and the opportunities of globalization is critical to the future development of rural regions in Europe, and will be important to the formulation and implementation of EU policies for the 2014-2020 programming period in at least three areas. Firstly, the appropriate identification of opportunities and challenges for rural areas within the global economy will be crucial to the development of Pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy, encouraging the diversification of rural economies. Since the Cork Declaration in 1996, EU rural development policy has emphasized endogenous \"bottom-up' approaches, led by regional actors and utilizing regional resources. As such, the fundamental questions for developing rural economies in the context of globalization are how to most effectively combine regional resources and global networks for economic gain, and how to best equip regional actors to engage with globalization processes.\\n\\nSecondly, the spatially-uneven impact of globalization processes across rural areas presents challenges for the EU's territorial cohesion policies. Rural areas include some of Europe's wealthiest regions, but also some of its poorest regions. The majority of the territory designated as Convergence Regions in the 2007-2013 programming period was comprised by rural regions, including nearly all rural regions in the 2004 and 2007 Accession States. Yet, conventional notions of the economic geography of \"core' and \"peripheral' regions  are being tested by globalization processes that have contributed to significant economic growth in peripheral regions such as the west of Ireland and northern Sweden, but have further eroded the economic position of other rural regions. An understanding of the spatial dynamics of globalization and of continuing relevance of geographical factors in shaping globalization experiences is hence important for developing effective territorial cohesion strategies.\\n\\nThirdly, the sustainable management of the abundant natural resources contained within Europe's rural regions will be pivotal to the delivery of EU environmental policies and its action to address global concerns such as climate change and biodiversity. The harnessing of natural resources to generate renewable energy and provide environmental services has the potential to produce both environmental and economic benefits. However, there is a risk that policies and initiatives championed from the top-down might be contested if they are perceived to conflict with established land management practices, economic interests or cultural traditions. Engaging rural people in inclusive approaches to sustainable development is hence essential for effective environmental action, including the new expectation on the Common Agricultural Policy to support ambitious climate, energy and biodiversity targets.\\n\\nScientific Context\\nIn spite of the opportunities and challenges for rural areas resulting from globalization described above, social science research on globalization in a rural context has until recently been over-shadowed by a predominant emphasis on urban regions and systems. Such research that has been conducted from a rural perspective has tended to focus on specific processes or sectors within the rural economy. Thus, for example, an extensive literature has emerged over the past decade on the global agri-food system, including work on \"global value chains' that has detailed transnational networks of agricultural production and supply (e.g. Stringer and Le Heron, 2008). Whilst some studies have examined the impact of global value chains on rural localities in the global south, there has been little comparable research on the consequences of agri-food globalization for rural areas in Europe.\\n\\nSimilarly, research on international migration has only recently started to expand its focus beyond cities to rural areas, prompted in part by the phenomenon of labour migration from Central and Eastern Europe to Britain and Ireland after EU enlargement in 2004. Research has subsequently documented the dynamics and experiences both of migrant workers and (to a lesser extent) of amenity migrants in rural regions of Europe, however, an emphasis on individual empirical studies has meant that this work remains relatively fragmented and largely disconnected from questions of rural development (see for example Jentsch and Simard, 2009). \\n\\nAccordingly, as Michael Woods has observed, this analysis has been missing ]the input of a substantial body of place-based studies - research that might not only adopt an integrated perspective in examining the impact of different forms and aspects of globalization in a rural locality, but that might also explore precisely how rural places are remade under globalization, and start to account for the differential geographies of globalization across rural space\" (Woods, 2007: 490)\\n\\nFurthermore, the few notable exceptions to this critique - largely studies in North America or Australia - have tended to present a fairly bleak and even fatalistic picture of rural localities struggling to cope with global competition and globalization-linked industrial restructuring, with only a few privileged resort locations reaping any benefits from globalization - a contrast articulated by Epp and Whitson (2001) as being between \"global dumping grounds' and \"global playgrounds'.\\n\\nThe DERREG research has consequently aimed to respond to Woods's challenge to develop an integrated and place-based analysis of globalization in a rural context, but also to counter the fatalism of some previous studies by examining opportunities for regional actors to make a difference and identifying examples of good practice. In doing so, DERREG has drawn particularly on two bodies of conceptual literature. \\n\\nFirstly, it has adopted the \"relational approach' to globalization associated with human geographers such as Doreen Massey and Ash Amin. This approach presents globalization not as a singular, domineering force, but rather as a disparate and diverse collection of processes and tendencies that involve the stretching, multiplication, intensification and re-alignment of social, economic and political relations over space. It holds that places are never truly isolated, but that the distinctive character of a place comes from the unique intersection of social and economic flows and networks that connect it to other places. Globalization therefore involves not the replacement of the local with the global, but more subtle changes to place that result from the stretching or subsitution of these ties. Thus, as Woods observes, ]places in the emergent global countryside retain their local distinctiveness, but they are also different to how they were beforeâ (Woods, 2007: 500).  As such, from a relational perspective, localities should be viewed never as the inevitable victims of globalization, nor as strongholds of resistance to globalization. Rather, the approach argues that the global is reproduced through the local, through processes of negotiation, manipulation and contestation that involve both local and non-local actors. In this way, the relational approach has important implications for our understanding of rural development in the context of globalization. It provides a framework for explaining why similar processes produce different outcomes in different regions, including by indicating that rural entrepreneurs, policy-makers, development agents and social movements might all be engaged in shaping these outcomes.\\n\\nSecondly, DERREG has drawn on the extensive academic literature on rural development, and especially work on endogenous rural development. This research has evolved concurrently with the implementation of bottom-up strategies for rural development in Europe, and has not only documented the practice and outcomes of this approach,  but has also analysed the dynamics and principles that underlie the approach and inform the effectiveness of different initiatives. These were summarized by the EU Framework Programme 6 project ETUDE in a diagrammatic \"web of rural development' that described the interactions between six domains: endogeniety, novelty-production, sustainability, social capital, institutional frameworks and market governance (van der Ploeg and Marsden, 2008). The interactions between these domains, it is suggested, shape the trajectories of rural development in different regions - novelty-production may be combined with market governance to create new branded products, for example, whilst social capital is identified as a critical lubricant for inter-relations.  \\n\\nThe rural web is useful in envisaging and analysing relations between actors within regions, however, it does not directly consider how regional actors engage with globalization processes, beyond reference to market governance. In seeking to emphasize the regional-global interface, DERREG has therefore additionally drawn on wider literature in relational economic geography on \"network economies'. This literature has emphasized the significance of \"intangible assets' and \"organized proximity' in the global economy, supplanting the previous tendency for spatial agglomeration, and has also pointed to the importance of business networks in diffusing information and driving entrepreneurship (Boschma, 2005; Johansson and Quigley, 2004). However, empirical research testing these theories has been limited, especially in a rural context.\\n\\nFurthermore, the design of DERREG stressed the perceived importance of knowledge not only to inter-regional networking, but also to intra-regional capacity building. This built on the findings of EU Framework Programme 6 project CORASON, which demonstrated both that rural regions can benefit from the global circulation of knowledge, and that local and lay knowledge are important to innovation (Tovey, 2008); but sought to develop the analysis by adapting the concept of \"learning regions' initially conceived to analyse the interaction of industry, government and science in technology-driven urban development (Rutten and Boekema 2007). \\n\\nProject Objectives\\nIn order to respond to issues raised by the policy and scientific contexts, and with the aim of contributing both to the advancement of scientific understanding and to policy development, DERREG adopted the overall objective of producing an interpretative model that will enable regional development actors to better anticipate and respond to the key challenges for rural regions arising from globalization.\\n\\nSupplementary objectives were to:  (1) Enrich the scientific evidence base for understanding globalization-led restructuring in rural regions; (2) Promote good practice in regional development responses by assembling a database of good practice examples; (3) Provide new insights into the challenges associated with particular processes of change, including the global engagement of rural enterprises, international migration, and the globalization of environmental discourse; (4) Develop understanding of the different challenges facing different types of rural region, thus assisting the fine-tuning of regional development strategies; (5) Establish a web-based resource centre to facilitate and coordinate the dissemination and accessibility of information to researchers, regional development actors and other users interested in the challenges of globalization for rural regions.\\n\\n\\nProject Results:\\nThe DERREG project has been undertaken by a consortium of nine universities and research institutes from across Europe, led by Aberystwyth University. To provide a place-based approach, research has been focused on ten case study regions located in eight countries, which were selected to represent a range of geographical and political-economic settings (see figure 1).\\n\\nThe research has also been organized around four themes reflecting key aspects of globalization processes and rural development responses (figure 2). The first theme has examined the global engagement and local embeddedness of rural businesses, and in particular, the transactional and support networks of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Led by Nordregio, research on this theme involved an e-mail survey of over 200 firms in five case study regions to collect data on the scale and reach of business networks, supplemented by structured interviews with company managers - designed to explore the characteristics and evaluations of interactions in more detail - and \"network brokers' in the public, private and voluntary sectors.\\n\\nThe second theme has investigated international mobility and migration to rural regions, focusing particularly on migrant workers, foreign home-owners and return transnational migrants. Led by the UniversitÃ¤t des Saarlandes, the research for this theme involved analysis of statistical and documentary evidence and qualitative interviews with migrants, municipal leaders and representatives of initiatives working with migrant communities. A total of 113 interviews were conducted with migrants across six case study regions, including 50 with migrant workers, 39 with foreign home-owners and 24 with return migrants.\\n\\nThe third theme has concerned environmental capital and sustainable rural development, exploring the incorporation of local and global environmental issues into regional development strategies and opportunities for the exploitation of rural environmental capital through sustainable development. The research for this theme, led by the Leibniz-Institut fÃ¼r LÃ¤nderkunde, involved the analysis of statistics, policy documents and media reports concerning environmental issues and sustainable development, interviews with regional stakeholders, and detailed case studies in each of five study regions.\\n\\nFinally, the fourth theme has examined capacity building, governance and knowledge systems, particularly by developing and applying the concept of \"rural learning regions'. Research, led by Wageningen University, was conducted in six case study regions and involved the mapping and analysis of policy strategies to support joint learning and innovation - drawing on web searches, literature reviews and expert interviews; the in-depth analysis of a sample of grassroots initiatives in each region, including further interviews; and the identification and analysis of \"well-working' examples.\\n\\nThe evidence from each of the four themes has been collated and combined with background statistical and documentary analysis to produce an overarching interpretative model, which is presented in this report. Additionally, examples of \"good practice' in regional development responses and initiatives were collected across the four themes and ten case study regions and compiled in a searchable database available.\\n\\nThe sections below present the main results from each of the four research themes, before describing how these results have informed the development of an interpretative model of globalization impacts and responses in rural regions.\\n\\nGlobal Engagement and Local Embeddedness of Rural Businesses\\nRural business networks are potentially a key component of a new approach to territorial rural development. This moves beyond outdated concepts of the rural economy as dependent upon urban spillovers and backwash effects, or compensation for locational disadvantage. Instead it acknowledges the fact that although some of the more extreme \"death of distance' predictions of the impact of improved transport, travel and communication technology have not materialised, and face-to-face communication still plays a key role in business life, a significant incremental shift is taking place. An increasing proportion of the interaction between rural firms is no longer constrained by physical distance. Key transactions, and also non-market linkages often involve partners beyond the region, or even outside the national boundary. In academic terminology, it could be said that firms are increasingly operating within relational, rather than Euclidean space, or that there has been a partial decoupling of organised and spatial proximity. This is important in terms of economic development, because the extra-regional linkages are believed to act as channels for technical information and market intelligence which drive innovation and sustain competitiveness.\\n\\nThe existing literature in relational economic geography has described the characteristics of transaction and non-market linkages, and outlined a number of different concepts of business networks, including industrial districts, clusters, milieu, innovateurs, learning regions, etc.. A key point that emerges across this literature is that business networking can act as a surrogate for agglomeration, allowing dispersed rural firms to compete with those operating in an urban or suburban environment. The preconditions for success of rural business networks relate not only to physical infrastructure, or availability of good access to information technology (such as high speed broadband), but also to a range of \"intangible assets'. These include human capital (education, age structure of the workforce etc), aspects of social capital (an outward looking, non risk-averse entrepreneurial culture, trust, cooperative ethos), facilitative governance arrangements and so on. It is also commonly argued that the most effective and dynamic business networks are those which combine dense and highly interactive patterns of local interaction with a smaller \"external' component. This idea is often referred to by the memorable phrases \"the strength of weak flows' or \"local buzz and global pipes' (Granovetter, 1985; Bathelt et al. 2004).\\n\\nBy combining lessons derived from this literature, a hypothesis was articulated for the DERREG research on the global engagement and local embeddedness of rural businesses, as follows:\\n\\nSuccessful and dynamic rural firms derive ]networking economiesâ from frequent and effective interaction, not only with the local business environment, but also with a much more extensive set of linkages, stretching out across Europe. This implies that global integration and more local \"territorial anchoring\", are not mutually exclusive. Indeed they are complimentary aspects of a ]survival strategyâ for SMEs in rural areas.\\n\\nThis hypothesis provided the framework for empirical research in five case study regions (Ãvre Norrland, Sweden; Alytus county, Lithuania; GoriÅ¡ka, Slovenia; JihomoravskÃ½ kraj, Czech Republic; and Westerkwartier, the Netherlands). The research comprised three surveys, two targeting local SMEs and one focused on \"network brokers' who seek to develop and enhance regional business networking. The first SME survey was an electronic (e-mail) survey, with mostly \"closed' questions amenable to qualitative scoring and simple descriptive statistical analysis. A quota sampling approach was employed, with a target of 50 responses in each case study region and over 200 responses eventually being received. The second SME survey took the form of structured interviews with a subset of respondents to the e-mail survey. The main findings from the research are outlined below.\\n\\n\"Open' rural economies\\nA degree of internationalization of business transactions was observed in all five case study regions, although with significant variation. The highest levels of international engagement were recorded in Slovenia and Sweden, and the lowest in Lithuania and the Netherlands, with survey respondents in the Czech Republic exhibiting a bipolar distribution between internationally active firms and enterprises trading on a largely regional scale (Table 1). These different patterns reflect a number of factors including sectoral structure, the size of the regional market, human capital (especially language skills), local planning policy, and proximity to national borders. Nevertheless, in spite of the observed differences, the underlying trend is clearly one of SME networks in rural regions opening up to interact beyond regional and national borders. Many respondents regarded internationalization as an important step in their business development, with improved transport and communications infrastructure helping to facilitate this expansion.\\n\\nEmbedded collaboration\\nThe \"collaborative space' of rural businesses is defined by the web of non-market relations developed by firms. Interactions with other companies are very important in product and process development, as well as for market consolidation and expansion. These interactions are especially important for SMEs that are too small to afford to fully internalize activities such as research and development or marketing. In contrast to transactional linkages, the survey data shows that non-market interactions continue to be largely concentrated within the home region or country, most commonly with other SMEs (Figure 3). Transnational non-market linkages are more common in the Slovenian and Swedish case studies, but even here significantly less than the density of international transactional networks. As such, the results question the assertion in the existing literature that transactional and non- market linkages are closely aligned (TÃ¶dling and Kaufmann, 1999), and point instead to the importance of \"institutional proximity' in building trust, and the role of face-to-face communication.\\n\\nTranslocal integration\\nThe international linkages recorded by the survey were predominantly with SMEs in other regions within Europe. This finding contrasts with the presumption in the existing literature that small firms are primarily enrolled in international networks through \"vertical integration' into global value chains controlled by large transnational corporations, usually as a supplier. Our evidence points instead to rural businesses developing direct networking with SMEs that occupy similar positions in the production chain in other countries, thus advancing a model of \"translocal integration' rather than distinctively \"global integration'. This may reflect the nature of products traded by rural enterprises, and the success of rural firms in carving out business spaces outside the sphere of large transnational corporations.\\n\\nMoreover, quantitative measures of the density or intensity of business interactions at different scales do not in themselves tell the whole story about global integration. Interviews conducted for the research suggest that international linkages are often more highly valued by firms than regional or national linkages. In particular, international networks are regarded as important for information exchange, especially with respect to market intelligence. The diffusion of technical innovations through international networks, emphasized in the existing literature (Bathelt et al., 2004), was less significant for the rural businesses studied.\\n\\nRegional support networks\\nThe rural firms responding to the survey predominantly continue to rely on regional or national institutions such as government agencies, trade organizations, research institutes and business consultants for support services. In some cases, the support mechanisms accessed have European Union funding, but are delivered regionally and there is little recorded direct interaction with organizations outside the home country for support services. One of the most notable forms of support provided to rural SMEs is \"network brokerage', which can perform one of two functions. Firstly, network brokers can act as \"match-makers' between individual SMEs to extend their networks, usually by adding international linkages. Secondly, network brokers can organize \"forum facilitation' activities bringing together firms with common interests to strengthen interactions and foster collective learning. Whilst the first function commonly supports international engagement, the second might consolidate regional embeddedness. A critical factor in the effectiveness of the first function is the quality and reach of the \"meta-networks' of network brokers that span different scales and can provide access to potential international partners.\\n\\nGeographical variations\\nAs noted above, comparative analysis of the five case study regions reveals a number of variations in the results that point to the continuing significance of geographical factors. Firstly, cross-border networking with adjacent regions in neighbouring countries contributed to the degree of internationalization in Slovenia, and to a lesser extent Sweden. In contrast, the border locations of the Lithuanian and Czech case study regions appeared to present fewer opportunities for cross-border interaction. Secondly, proximity to domestic markets is a negative factor in stimulating internationalization - firms in regions with relative ease of access to sizeable domestic markets, as in the Dutch case study, have less of an incentive to develop international linkages than firms in more remote regions with smaller domestic markets, as in the Swedish case study. Thirdly, variations in national and regional policies can have an effect. Spatial planning policies in the Netherlands, for example, militated against the development of internationally-engaged businesses in the rural Westerkwartier, whilst policies in the Czech Republic are more favourable to industrial investment, possibly contributing to the higher degree of enrolment in vertically-integrated networks observed for firms in the region. Similarly, the emphasis of network brokering activities varied, with network brokers in Sweden and the Netherlands focusing on connecting firms to intra-regional and international networks, and network brokers in Lithuania, Slovenia and the Czech Republic em ..."

       " \"executive summary:\\nthe chemical stitching und continuous preforming technologies had been developed independently and needed to be combined into an integrated process. this necessitated extensive design work and the manufacture and assembly of a new preform production line.\\nthe forming, stitching and curing units though had to be designed specifically for the final product(s) to be produced on the device. the first step in the production is the cross section forming. to learn more about the possibilities of the cross sectional several concepts for draping mechanisms were considered   and tested in the form of lab scale prototype devices (d2-2) to help choose the best technology for the final design. the two possibilities that exist are preforming with a solid forming tool and preforming using a set of rollers. for the preform geometry with l sections and flat doublers, the forming method of the roller based technique was chosen for best quality.\\n\\nthe rollers gradually change the flat textile into the l shape. after the forming and before the stabilisation of the stitching the shape is kept by a snug fitting solid tool, that is able to guide the preform but is too narrow for the flat doubler. the doubler preform is transported up and over the roller section of the preforming unit and passes the section thus without any clearance issued. \\nthe chemical stitching was also advanced. first, concepts were developed how multiple stitching points can be set simultaneously. also it was considered, what kind of injectors could be used in the final design. the simple injector used before was replaced with one that can deliver the controlled resin amounts necessary for the industrial application of this technology, this new injector was tested in a lab scale prototype of the stitching unit to determine the best process parameters concerning adhesive amount, curing time, curing temperature etc. in the detailed design of the production line the stitching unit was designed to reflect the production of the two different profile geometries. \\nthe manufacturing and assembly of the new preforming line was completed on time. the integration of the resin injectors was the more challenging task. the injectors must move at the same speed than the textile layers through the preforming device. at the same time, they must also move up and down. these individual movements must be synchronised for the process to function. other parameters like the resin viscosity, which depends on the amount of curing agent, also influence the setting of these movements. the viscosity influences the injection time, which is limited by the maximum pressure the injectors can achieve. the amount of curing agent curing agent must be set according to the speed of the textile, because this determines the amount of time the resin points will remain in the hot curing zone.\\nafter lengthy optimisation of these parameters and the chemical stitching device, a functioning, stable and high quality process was achieved. due to the automated and continuous manner of the preform production line, even a 24 hour usage of the device is viable with minimal downtime. under these conditions, a production rate of 1000 m of stacked, shaped, stabilised, cut and infusion ready preforms is not unrealistic.\\n\\nproject context and objectives:\\nlightweight requirements have always accelerated innovation in the aviation industry and have found their current highpoint in the extensive application of composite materials in the airbus a350 and boeing 787. lightweight structures help save fuel and co2 making transport by aircraft at the same time more economical and more ecological. increasingly though, in order to further european competitiveness, cost requirements also play a large role in the airplane design. this leads to two developments: firstly the use of dry fibre textiles and liquid composite moulding (lcm) technology instead of prepreg processes; and secondly the need for highly automated processes. these goals are somewhat in contrast to each other, since todayâ\\x80\\x99s prepreg processes are to a large degree automated while dry fibre textiles are more difficult to handle in automated processes. from this arises the need to develop fully automated dry fibre preform processes.\\nfully automated preform processes are especially needed for the production of small parts which occur in high numbers. to mind come profiles such as stringers, frames and spars for which several kilometres of profile preforms need to be produced for each aircraft, resulting in a huge number of necessary preforms is one considers the future rates of aircraft production of more than 40 aircraft per months for single aisle aircraft. such profile preforms are well fitted for continuous automated processes. todayâ\\x80\\x99s state of the art continuous preforming technologies such as pultrusion however, do not offer the necessary quality and process control for aerospace applications. new preform processes must be developed to accommodate the demand for a fully automated preforming process for the production of 3d-shaped dry fibre profiles for the aerospace industry.\\n\\ntodayâ\\x80\\x99s preforming technologies are largely manual, thus increasing the costs of liquid composite moulding (lcm) technologies such as resin transfer moulding (rtm). systems that can drape 3d profiles automatically and continuously, such as the one developed by fibre, have just left the development stage but are in need of further development to in-crease productivity and quality. the projectâ\\x80\\x99s objective is to develop a fully automated dry fibre preform process for 3d-shaped composite profiles that uses the energy efficient chemical stitching technology.\\nthe chemical stitching (cs) technology offers a way to reduce the lead time by replacing the time consuming binder application with localised adhesives application. for the application, needles are be used which inject either a thermoplastic (hot melt) or thermoset (microwave curing) adhesive between the layers. this will also improve permeability and thus the quality of the finished part. furthermore is the chemical stitching technology more energy efficient because melting or curing of the adhesive is restricted to minimal areas and volumes. \\nin previous investigations within cleansky ecodesign project, the feasibility of chemical stitching approach was demonstrated by fraunhofer gesellschaft with ultraviolet (uv) and microwave (mw) curing adhesive. \\nthe process starts with positioning of the adhesive application head on the textile structure which should be fixed. at the same time the textile structure is fixed mechanically. after-wards thin injection needles are driven into the textile structure to implicate minimal amount of the chosen binder adhesive between the layers. following step is to cure the implemented adhesive. \\n\\nthe local adhesive implementation via chemical stitching approach shows a lot of advantages compared to areal bindering. these advantages are:\\nâ\\x80¢\\ttwo times faster vari infiltration of the preform (nearly the same as unbindered) due to a better permeability \\nâ\\x80¢\\tsame peeling forces by using 3 times lower amount of binder \\nâ\\x80¢\\tsame preform compressibility as a nonbindered textile structure.\\nâ\\x80¢\\t higher peeling strength by using same amount of binder,\\nâ\\x80¢\\tfurthermore is the chemical stitching technology more energy efficient because melting or curing of the adhesive is restricted to minimal areas and volumes.\\n\\nthe cs technology is today only available as a lab scale test bench based on a gantry device. in this project the cs technology shall be advanced to level where it can function in a relevant industrial environment alongside other proven technologies. for this the process must move away from a single injector gantry device to a process that can stitch in parallel with very high speeds to match the line speed of the preforming process. in the lab device, the fabric is fixated with a vertical stamp. in the continuous process this will have to be removed to make the continuous movement of the fabric possible. this removal is easily implementable, because in the continuous preforming device, the fabrics are fixated in any case by the rollers that form and transport the fabric.\\nwith the technology previously developed by fibre it is possible to produce full scale aerospace preform profiles of different geometries including complex lcf-frames, sidestepping any problems that will arise from up scaling. up scaling is extremely difficult for fabric related processes because the weave cannot be scaled up or down without significantly changing the drapeability of the fabric. the prototype uses sets of rollers to form the flat fabric into the desired shape. the line speed can reach up to 10 m/min. dependent on the profile geometry will the fabric layers fixed to each other before or after the forming sequence, using powdered binder across the entire area of the preform. the prototype includes devices for producing curved preforms, automatic cutting, and automatic removal of the preforms at the end. \\nthis 3-d preforming technology can be combined with the chemical stitching technology to create an automated solution for a continuous, energy efficient process for the manufacturing of 3-d shaped composite dry fibre profiles. this requires developing the chemical stitching technology further from the current lab-scale batch process to an industrial scale that can function continuously. the stitching speed also has to be synchronised with the speed of the preforming process. in order to apply the adhesive in parallel to the preforming process an array of needles will inject the adhesive at different places simultaneously. because the cycle of filling the injector, positioning it, injecting the adhesive, and retracting the injector is too time consuming, several injectors have to be arranged in sequence. to match the chemical stitching speed to the preforming speed several sets of needles need to be used. another solution would be to move the needles horizontally to match the velocity of the fabric. the cs device is arranged past the preforming device to fix the fabric in its new shape.\\nin a second phase after the current project, it can be matched with a continuous curing technology. the basic technology of the continuous curing is has been developed also at fibre, but to bring it to industrial maturity further development is needed. this applies specifically to profile geometries that vary along their length e.g. due to ramps, steps or joggles. \\nthis project's objective was the development of a preforming process that can produce reinforcement profiles preforms that are stabilised by chemical stitching. chemical stitching is a technology to fixate the textile layers using very small amounts of locally applied liquid adhesive. the industry standard way is to use powdered binder adhesive across the entire textile surface. replacing this with the minimum amount of adhesives used in chemical stitching improves infusion characteristics and laminate quality.\\nthe process is fully automated and was validated by producing spar preforms, of high enough quality to integrate them into the cs eda wp2 demonstrator a4 â\\x80\\x9caileron of do 228â\\x80\\x9d.\\n\\nproject results:\\nconcepts for draping mechanisms \\nto study the process of continuously preforming of a flat textile tape into a three-dimensional profile geometry a continuous preforming prototype was developed and build.  the prototype works like the later to be build final preforming device but allows more freedom to change the preforming technique used. a proposed setup uses a solid metal forming tool, to form the flat textile tape on the right into a three-dimensional profile. this technique is investigated as an easier, less complicated way to shape the textile than the previously used technique with rollers. the continuous preforming prototype can, nonetheless, also be used with rollers in which the roller positions and attitudes can be changed in a greater degree than a final version that will be optimised towards an ideal shape.\\nconcepts for stitching design\\nfor the stitching injector a two-component injector head will be used.  it can be filled with the two components of an adhesive which will be mixed at the moment of injection. this way no pre-mixed adhesives have to be used. pre-mixed adhesives always have a limited use time, because the adhesive is slowly curing inside the adhesive reservoir. this can be avoided with the two-component head. it is also capable of injecting the highly viscous adhesive in a very short time. high viscosity is needed to achieve a localised disposition of the adhesive. if the viscosity is chosen too low it will be soaked up by the surrounding fibres instead of staying at the injection point. high viscosity on the other hand is detrimental to a short injection time. the chosen injector type is able to achieve a short injection even at the high viscosity that is needed. before the final choice is made, the injector head will be tested with the actual adhesive to be used in the project.\\nto further increase the production speed, a multi-needle setup will be used. the injector head is going to be equipped with multiple needles. this way, several stitching points can be set at the same time and no movement of the injector head in the transversal y-axis is required.\\nselection of technology for draping (rollers) and stitching (injector specified)\\neven though a new draping mechanism using a solid tool was studied with a lab scale device, the known technique of gradually forming the flat textile into the desired shape. the rollers give better control of the preform especially considering the switch to l-profiles and even flat preforms (if they can be called as such). a c-preform is stabilised when it runs through the preforming device because its two flanges grip around the positive toll and so it cannot move left or right. an l-profile is not stabilised as such. therefore it was decided revert back to the roller based setup planned in the beginning.\\nfor the stitching unit an injector, that fulfilled the criteria for industrial use was selected. up to this point, the chemical stitching used an injector that could only be used for very slow stitching of the textile, and would not be acceptable in an industrial application. the chosen injector head is the viscotec viscoduo v- 4/4. it is capable of placing very small amounts of resin at a speed that is usable in the integrated process. this is important because exact control over the deposited amounts of resin is necessary to produce preforms that are both stable but also have only a minimal amount of stitching resin in them. a too low amount of deposited resin in a stitching point would lower the preform stability necessary for subsequent handling and injection steps.  a too high amount of resin would block the bath of injection resin in this area and would therefore be detrimental to preform permeability and also laminate mechanical properties.\\nfinal design of integrated preforming production line achieved (ms2)\\nthe most significant achievement is the final design for the integrated preform production line. it combines two very innovative technologies. the design also incorporates all the knowledge previously gained in this project. the tasks that preceded the final design advanced the preforming and stitching technology so that it could be integrated into an industrially usable machine.\\nan overview of the complete preform production line is given in fig 6, in which the subunits that are combined to form and fixate the preform are shown. the subunits demonstrate the modularized, flexible design of the preforming production line. to the right is the material store unit where the different textile tapes for the different geometries are stored as coils. to the far left is the drive unit that pulls these tapes through the production line. in between the entire forming and fixation process takes place, completely automated. the flat tapes are formed into their 3-dimensional geometry (in case of the l-sections) in the preforming unit and fixated in their shape by chemical stitching in the subsequent stitching and curing units. the report will now take a closer look at each individual subunit.\\nstorage unit\\nas previously stated, the production of preforms begins with the material storage unit. in this unit four tape reels can be stored to be used in the preform production. the number of individual coils is not just governed by the amount of plies necessary to reach the desired laminate thickness, but also by the laminate design itself. this means that in components with different mechanical loads, taped of different fibre orientations will be used in order to tailor the mechanical properties of the laminate. for the spar preforms 0â° and â±45â° non-crimp fabric (ncf) carbon fibre tapes will be used. the 0â° tapes will be used predominantly in the spar caps (the l-sections), where tensile and compressive loads dominate. the straight 0â° fibres of the ncf are best suited to carry these loads. in the spar web, the doublers, shear loads dominate. thus, â±45â° tapes are used for the doublers since the main load direction of a shear force is in the â±45â° direction. however, because the tapes are pulled through the preforming line, a few 0â° glass fibres are introduced into the â±45â° tapes to stabilize them when being pulled. with the four coils in the material storage unit, all necessary material can be stored in the machine at all times. in the future, the material storage could be expanded to include more coils, if a wider variety of material is to be combines in one preform.\\npreforming unit\\nthe preforming unit as is one of the central aspects of the automated preform production line. the preforming line will be able to produce two different geometries, the l-caps and the flat double webs. this will be possible without any changes to the preforming unit because two paths through the unit are possible. the lower, straight path forms the l sections, while for the flat doublers, for which no forming is necessary, the tapes are routed above the forming tool and back down at the end of the unit before the stitching unit. compared to the final design of the substructure the path of the flat doubler preform was changed to integrate it better with the other subunits. because the doublers and caps use different tapes as described in the previous paragraph, the production can be changed from one geometry to the next quickly. the l-section is formed by a set of rollers and a solid metal forming tool. first the rollers change the flat textile gradually from the flat tape into the final shape by increasing the angle of the l from 0â° to the final 100â° (outside angle). the solid forming tool then stabilises the preform until it can be fixated in the stitching and curing units. \\nstitching unit\\nthat two component geometries are being fabricated on the same machine is also reflected in the design of the stitching unit, as seen in a top-down view in fig 9. during the stitching process two stitching heads inject small amounts of a 2-component resin between the textile layers. because of the constant movement of the textile substrate, the injection heads must move in a synchronized movement along the axis of production. the injection heads are therefore attached two linear drives that are synched up with the machine through a computer. in order to eliminate any chance of collision between the stitching heads, the linear drive are mounted behind each other even though the rows of stitching points made by each are parallel. the horizontal movement f the stitching heads in the machine x-direction (the direction of production) is overlaid with a motion orthogonal to the substrate. this is necessary to push the needle in between the textile layers, where the resin is to be deposited and pull it out again after all resin is at the correct place. this motion is either in the z-axis or the y-axis depending on the geometry of the preform. for the flat doublers, both injector heads perform virtually identical motions in the x and z-directions. for the l-sections though, because the two flanges are at an angle close to 90â°, one injector heads has to work in the y-direction (horizontally). for this, one injector head can be swung down and arrested in a second position to set the row of stitching points on the vertical frame.\\ncuring unit\\nthe curing unit is necessary to cure the resin injected as a form of preform stabilisation in the previous step. it consists of compaction section and the heating section. in the first section a series of rollers compact the textile layers again after the stitching process, and before the curing. after the curing, the injected resin points are hardened and the textile layers cannot be moved again. it must be made sure therefore, that before the resin is cured the preform is compacted to its desired thickness. the stitching points are cured by a set of infrared heaters. the length of the heating zone has been chosen that with the given power output of the heaters, the resin is fully cured while moving continuously along through the heating zone at the desired production speed.\\ndrive unit\\nat the very end of the preform production line, sits the drive unit. the drive wheels are pressed down on the preforms and pull all textile layers through the entire production line. this way, the textile layers always under tension, which works against the formation of undulations due to compressive forces in the textile. it requires a small amount of 0â° fibres in â±45â° layers though, because usually pulling a â±45â° textile in the 0â° direction means strong deformation because â±45â° fibres cannot transmit the tensile loads of a 0â° pulling action. \\nmaterial and lay-up \\nas lay-up a symmetrical stacking of (â±45/0)s was chosen for the spars. the doublers will contain the same material with a lay-up of (â±45/0/â±45). by choosing these stackings and textiles it was realised to use the same supply-coils for spars and doublers. the resulting fibre-volume content will be 54% for the spars and 59% for the doublers.\\npreform production line\\nan overview of the complete preform production line is given in fig 6, in which the subunits that are combined to form and fixate the preform are shown. the subunits demonstrate the modularized, flexible design of the preforming production line. to the right is the material store unit where the different textile tapes for the different geometries are stored as coils. to the far left is the drive unit that pulls these tapes through the production line. in between the entire forming and fixation process takes place, completely automated. the flat tapes are formed into their profile geometry (in case of the l-sections) in the preforming unit and fixated in their shape by chemical stitching in the subsequent stitching and curing units. \\n\\nassembly of prototype\\nin order to validate the function of the basic preforming operation of the preform production line, the shape giving features of the device were tested. the spar caps (l-geometry) consist of four layers of non-crimp fabric (ncf). these layers are being reeled off the material store reels and combined into a flat stack before being fed into the preforming unit. the single layers have to be aligned precisely to form an even stack. any misalignment in this part of the production line will result in problems in the later units. the stack is being fed through solid shaping tools in the later steps. also, misalignment of the single layers cannot be corrected later in the production line so that any geometry deviation will manifest in out-of-tolerance parts in the end.  the reels carrying the material are braked to ensure a constant tension on the layers.\\nafter the layers are combined the preforming unit forms the flat stack into an l-shaped profile. a set of rollers is used for a gradual forming of the flat tapes. the rollers only use little down force, to avoid damaging the fabric. their function is also not consolidation of the preform, which happens later in the production line but just shaping. the rollerâ\\x80\\x99s shapes change from the right to the left, gradually increasing the angle of the â\\x80\\x9clâ\\x80\\x9d shape. the down force of the rollers can be adjusted manually and is calibrated at the start of the production cycle. the down force is set so that the preform can be pulled through the entire production line without damaging the textile while at the same time forcing the flat tape into the desired shape.\\nthe preform is being passed through a solid shaping tool after the section with the rollers that has very little tolerance on any geometry deviations. if the preform can be fed through the tool it has exactly the necessary shape and is ready to be used in further processes.\\nthe maximum line speed that can be reached in the device is 1 m/min. the limiting factor is the synchronisation between the drives that move the injector head and the drive that pulls the preform through the line. the chemical stitching unit and subsequently also the curing unit were not used at this stage, because the special injectors for the chemical stitching could not be delivered in time. these steps will be done in the beginning of 2014.\\n\\npreform optimisation\\nafter the successful assembly and initial operation of the prototype preform production line, the process parameters could be adjusted to achieve a fast and stable process that produces high quality parts. the optimisation parameters are mostly interdependent, which mostly stems from the fact that two technologies, chemical stitching and continuous preforming, were combined in this project. the process parameters that were varied in the course of the process optimisation are the following:\\n-\\tline speed\\n-\\tcontinuous / semi continuous process\\n-\\tneedle geometry\\n-\\tresin viscosity\\n-\\tstack consolidation /spread\\n-\\tinjection pressure\\n-\\tinjection time\\n-\\tother injection parameters\\nin an integrated process such as the combination of automated preforming and chemical stitching in one device that was the centre of the project achso, the individual parameters are rarely independent of each other. changing one parameter often results in better performance in one part of the production line but worse performance in another. the interdependencies can often be estimated qualitatively but the exact influences of one on another are not known for new processes such as this. a lot of experience is necessary to achieve control over the process. this experience cannot be derived through other means as trial and error experiments.\\nline speed is obviously important for the economic production of preforms. continuous production processes are deployed, when a high number of parts are needed. the line speed was chosen as the overall goal parameter in this process. as in many processes, production speed is inversely coupled with production quality. at low speeds an exact control of all parts of the integrated process line is possible, but production is not economic. increasing the speeds lets one usually produce quality parts until a certain cut off point is reached and the produced parts do not comply with the requirements anymore. following the philosophy of â\\x80\\x9cas exact as necessary and not as exact as possibleâ\\x80\\x9d this cut off point must be found. depending on the stability of the process and the tolerances of the requirements the set of parameters that bring one closest to this red line with a stable process must be found.\\nthe programming of the drives for pulling the fibre preform and for moving the injector heads let the user choose between two process states. firstly a continuous process that required parallel synchronised motion of the fibre preform substrate and the resin injector heads, this is the one that should be used for an economic process. secondly a semi-continuous process in which the movement of the fibre preforms was halted during the chemical stitching. no x-movement of the injector is necessary in this case. this mode should only be used in the set-up stage as it is considerably slower than the continuous one. \\nhowever, it lets the user decouple the preforming and the chemical stitching processes. on the one hand this makes it easier to find the right parameters for each singular process. on the other hand, once going back to the continuous process the interdependencies between the two processes must be found, as described above. because the injectors that are responsible for the chemical stitching are a very complex system in itself, the semi-continuous process was used to understand their behaviour and produce stitch points that were considered acceptable. the next step was to produce these stitch points in the continuous process.\\nin the stitching process alone several parameters can be adjusted. the resin itself can be varied in its viscosity. the reason to increase the viscosity is the behaviour of it in the textile preform. with the usual viscosity, the resin can be injected very easily between the preform layers, but is dispersed there in a wide area due to the capillary forces between the filaments. it is, in effect, sucked up by the fabric substrate like water by a cloth and cannot form a localised stitch point. the viscosity of the resin can be adjusted by adding calcium carbonate to the resin. the median size of the caco particles is 2.7 âµm so it can be dispersed in the liquid resin easily. increasing the resin viscosity, will make it harder and harder to transport it through the injectors and the needles into the preform. this will increase the time necessary to stitch one point, slowing down the process. it might also result in injection pressures that are too high for any of the parts involved, the weakest usually being the static mix tube. the concentration of caco was increased until the viscosity was high enough to sufficiently stay at the stitch point. the chosen mixture was resin weight to caco 1:1.4. \\nto lower the injection pressure, a larger diameter needle might be used. the limit for the needle geometry is the ability to penetrate the preform. if the needle is too thick it might either not perforate the upper layers of the textile at all or damage the punctured fibres in a way that is detrimental to preform quality. the needle can penetrate the upper layers more easily it has a chamfered tip instead of a flat tip. this is turn smears the resin over a larger area in the z-direction (thickness), which can be positive or negative depending on the degree of consolidation that is chosen for the preform at this point. if the preform is strongly compacted the chamfering might result in spilling most of the resin on top of the preform because part of the needle opening sticks out of the textile stack. if, on the other hand, the layers are spread out the chamfering can aid in spreading the resin regularly between all the layers. a good compromise was found with needles of 0.84 mm diameter and a 20â° chamfered tip.\\nthe consolidation of the stack can be adjusted by adding rollers or spreaders in the area directly in front of the stitching area. in the forming part of the preforming line, a set of rollers is used to bring the flat material into the desired l-shape. this also leads to a pre-compaction of the textile stack. the consolidation of the textile stack during the stitching influences the final preform in several ways. with a high consolidation, the resistance for the resin to flow through the layers and wet each layer is high. the chance of failure to stitch all layers rises. on the other hand does a high degree of consolidation lead to a good, localised application of the resin and a small stitch point. if the resin in injected into a less consolidated stack later consolidation tend to smear the resin across a wider area. the lower consolidation raises the permeability of the stack and makes it thus easier for the resin to flow through the preform. this lowers injection pressures and injection time and ultimately leads to higher line speeds. to spread the layers after the pre-consolidation in the forming section, a comb can be placed directly in front of the stitching area. this separates the layers and creates a space between each of them into which the resin can flow without much resistance. in the end the comb was chosen over the extra roller to achieve greater separation and a better overall process.\\n\\nproduction of preforms\\nin the report of the preceding deliverable d6-1, the process optimisation was described
